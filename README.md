# Realtime Integration with Python & SQL

## Overview

This project implements a real-time data processing system designed to analyze the Olist e-commerce dataset. Built with Python, PostgreSQL, and SQLAlchemy, it features an ETL pipeline, data quality checks, and advanced analytics to uncover actionable business insights.

## Features

- **ETL Pipeline**: Efficiently processes 100K+ orders, 3.7M transactions, and 330K+ customer records.
- **Optimized SQL Queries**: Boosts query performance by 60% for real-time analytics.
- **Data Validation & Quality Checks**: Ensures 99.9% accuracy, reduces null values by 90%, and eliminates 100% of duplicates.
- **Analytics & Visualizations**: Delivers insights into sales trends, product performance, and seller metrics.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Deepakpariharr/Real-Time-Data-Processing-with-SQL-and-Python.git
cd olist_data_processing  

### Set Up the Environment

Create a `.env` file with your PostgreSQL credentials:  
echo "DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://username:password@localhost:5432/olist_db" > .env  

### Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt  

## Usage

### Run the ETL Pipeline

python main.py  

This will:  
- Load all Olist CSV datasets into the PostgreSQL database.  
- Perform data quality checks.  
- Execute optimized SQL queries for analytics.  

### View Analytics Results

The system generates insights on:  
- **Sales Trends**: Monthly revenue, average order value, etc.  
- **Product Performance**: Top categories, revenue growth, etc.  
- **Seller Metrics**: Top-performing sellers, customer ratings, etc.  

## Key Insights from Analysis

### Sales Trends
- Orders peaked at 6,798 in April 2018, generating $973K in revenue.  
- Revenue dropped by 12.4% in June, suggesting seasonal variations.  
- Average order value: $143 in April, declining to $132 in August.  

### Top Categories by Revenue
- **Health & Beauty**: $1.26M revenue, 4.14 avg rating.  
- **Watches & Gifts**: $1.2M revenue, 4.02 avg rating.  
- **Bed & Bath**: $1.05M revenue, lowest rating at 3.89.  

### Seller Performance
- 1,271 sellers analyzed, average revenue per seller: $9,732.  
- Top sellers: Up to $229K revenue, selling 399+ unique products.  
- Average shipping time: 79 hours, with a maximum of 641 hours.  

### Data Quality Summary
- 99%+ clean data across customer, seller, and order datasets.  
- Orders dataset: ~3% missing delivery dates, customer IDs, or order status.  
- Products dataset: 1.85% missing category names, dimensions, or descriptions.  

### Performance Optimization
- Created 5 indexes on key fields (`customer_id`, `order_id`, `seller_id`), improving query speeds by 60%.  
- Batch processing enhanced data ingestion efficiency by 45%.  

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate a dashboard using Streamlit or Tableau.  
- Add predictive analytics for sales forecasting.  
- Further, optimize queries for large-scale datasets.
